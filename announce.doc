        Documentation
        
                Quick start (or what you really should know)
                ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
        
        Announcer  is  completely  controlled from the command line and its
        configuration  file  (see  their  respective chapters). There is no
        interactive  part,  which  makes  it  easy to set the program up to
        automatically post files. This also implies that you need to know a
        bit  about  how  the  program  is  controlled before it's usable. I
        therefor  recommend  you  to read through the two chapters "Command
        line  format" and "The configuration file", or at least the remarks
        in  the sample configuration file that comes with the program. This
        will save you a great deal of work.
        
        If  you want to use the standard settings that exist for Announcer,
        you simply enter
        
                ANNOUNCE
        
        at  the command line, and the program will execute. It will now use
        the  standard  configuration  file ANNOUNCE.INI and do what is told
        there. If any errors occur, they will be printed on the screen, and
        the  program  execution  will  end. A common error is that files or
        message  bases  are  missing,  which mostly is caused by misspelled
        file  names,  but it can also be caused by the file or message base
        being locked by another program.
        
        If you wish to use the settings of another configuration file, read
        the  chapter  titled  "Command line format". If you want to use the
        possability  to  specify  sender  and receiver names on the command
        line, see the chapter "The %1 and %2 variables". If you want a more
        detailed  description  on how the configuration file is structured,
        see  the  chapter  "ANNOUNCE.INI, the configuration file". See also
        the examples in the included sample configuration file.
        
        And  if  you  want  to  learn  everything, read this manual through
        carefully and memorize it :-)
        
        I  also would like you to read the chapter "Status", which includes
        information on how to pay for the program.
        
                Background
                ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
        
        I  originally  wrote  this  program  for a local BBS, where I and a
        couple  of  my  friends  "competed"  on  who  could  write the most
        messages,  and  since  I don't like to be on-line, I downloaded the
        mail and read it off-line. The problem then was that I was not able
        to  check  the  statistics  when  I  was offline, and that I always
        forgot to check it when I was on-line.
        
        So,  therefore  I wrote this program, initially a very limited one,
        but  as  the  beta testers and I personally came up with new ideas,
        the program grown out of this limited version to what it now is. It
        is  now  able  to do more than only post top-ten-lists, it can post
        welcoming  messages  to  new  users,  conference  rules in echomail
        areas,  automatic reminders, and much more. Your imagination is the
        limit  (okay,  so long as it is inside the program's area. It won't
        operate your microwave oven).
        
                Status
                ÄÄÄÄÄÄ
        
        This program is shareware. This means that you have right to freely
        distribute  this  program.  If you use it in more than thirty days,
        you  have  to  register the program, i.e. pay a sum of money to the
        author.  Shareware  is  not  a kind of program, just a distribution
        method like retail software. A registration form is included in the
        end of this file.
        
        With  shareware  you  get the ultimate money-back guarantee, if you
        don't use the product, you don't have to pay for it.
        
        This  program  is  not  crippled  in the shareware version, since I
        don't  believe  in  crippled  demo versions. The only difference is
        that  the  brag  line  will  not have a plus sign after the version
        number  and  that  an extra kludge line will be written, indicating
        that it is the unregistered version you are using.
        
                License
                ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
        
        Use  of  this  program  is  allowed  as  above. Exceptions from the
        thirty-days-rule  are accepted when you have registered the program
        but  not  yet  received  a  receipt  of your payment. A single user
        license  allows  the  use of this program on one single computer at
        any  given  time. A multi-user license allows use on many computers
        at  the same time, but only on a maximum of the number of computers
        for  which the fee has been paid. Registration allows free usage of
        all  future  versions  as  above.  Upgrades can be ordered from the
        author.

        ANNOUNCE /?
        
          /I[drive:][path]filename
        
        This   parameter   tells  Announcer  that  it  is  to  use  another
        configuration  file than ANNOUNCE.INI, which is the default (unless
        you  have  changed  the name of the executable file, Announcer uses
        the  name  and  path of this file to create the name of the default
        configuration  file,  so  if  you  have changed the program name to
        A.EXE, the default configuration file name will be A.INI).
        
          /D
        
        This  option  will tell Announcer not to post messages, but instead
        show  satus information. The things that are shown is how long time
        have passed since the messages have been posted, the intervals that
        have  been  specified for the messages (if any), the wanted minimum
        size,  the  existance  of a semaphore file, and the MSGID that were
        used  at  the last posting. Please notice that you need to have run
        Announcer  at  least  once  to  be  able  to  use this command line
        switch.
        
          /M
        
        This command line parameter will get Announcer to clean up the data
        file,  so  that items that are in the file which does not match any
        message template in the configuration file will be removed. This is
        useful when message templates have been deleted from the data file.
        It  can  only  be  used  together  with  /D,  and will otherwise be
        ignored.  Please  note  that if the data file and the templates get
        "out  of  sync",  for example if you delete a template somewhere in
        the  middle,  you  cannot  use  /M,  but  have  to  use the special
        PlaceHolder token instead.
        
          /P
        
        When  specifying  this  command  line parameter, Announcer will not
        create  tear lines in the messages it creates, but instead show its
        name  in a PID kludge. When posting echomail to message bases, this
        command  line  option  will  also result in Announcer not adding an
        Origin  line,  leaving  that  to  the tosser. When in .PKT mode, an
        Origin line will be created, but no tear line.
        
        Please  note that the tosser TerMail, at least in some versions, do
        not  add  a  tear and Origin line when tossing, so this option will
        then   generate   invalid   messages   according   to  the  Fidonet
        specifications. Use with caution.
        
          /Q
        
        This  command  line  option  will  inhibit  Announcer  from showing
        anything on the screen, except for error messages, which are always
        printed to the stderr device.
        
          name1
          name2
        
        These  texts will be use wherever you enter %1 or %2, respectively,
        in  the configuration file. They may be used to make it possible to
        post  a  standardized  message  to  different people. If you want a
        space  in  the  name  you  should  exchange  it  with an underscore
        character  ("_"). If you don't supply any names both %1 and %2 will
        have  the  value  "Announcer".  If you only supply one name %2 will
        give  "Announcer" while %1 will have the value you specified. These
        names have no effect when used together with /D.
        
          /S
        
        Use  this  command  line  option  to  simulate  a run by Announcer.
        Announcer will do everything like if it has been a real run, except
        that  it  won't  create  the  messages  or semaphores, it won't log
        anything  to the log file (it is instead logged to the screen), and
        the  data  file  is  not  updated. This can be useful for debugging
        configuration files.
        
          /?
        
        Displays the quick help screen.
        
                ANNOUNCE.INI, the configuration file
                ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
        
        The configuration file, default name ANNOUNCE.INI, tells Announcder
        what  it  is  supposed to do, and in what way it should be done. To
        use  Announcer,  a  configuration  file  is  a  must,  and  to  use
        Announcer's functions I recommend you to read through this chapter.
        Some  explanations  are  also  included in the sample configuration
        file that comes with the distribution archive.
        
        If  you  want comments in the file you can enter them on lines that
        have a semi colon (";") in the left-hand position.
        
        By  default,  Announcer  will look for a configuration file that is
        placed  in the same directory as the program, and that has the same
        name,  except  that  the  file  type  is .INI. Remember that if you
        change   the   program  name,  if  you  change  it  to  A.EXE,  the
        configuration file name will default to A.INI.
        
        For  each configuration file, a data file, with the file type .DAT,
        will  be  created. This file contains information on latest posting
        date,  used by the interval handling, as well as the MSGID that was
        used,  so that the next posting can contain a REPLY kludge. (If you
        have "ReplyKludge No" set, no REPLY kludge will be created, but the
        MSGID will still be logged).
        
        The configuration file contains two different "areas", the first is
        the  global  area  where  you  define  default  settings  for  alle
        massages,  and  the second area is the individual settings for each
        message  that  is  to be created. The settings that are used in the
        two areas are completely different, but they have influence on each
        other.
        
        Each message template begins with a line which has the only word
        Page 4                                              Announcer v1.11
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

                Msg
        
        on it, and is ended with the text
        
                .End
        
        Between these lines the configuration posts that are needed for the
        message  are  placed,  and outside these the global settings can be
        set.  Note  that  there  is  no  requirement on the ordering of the
        different settings.
        
        If  you wish Announcer to skip over a message template, e.g. if you
        remove  one  in  the  middle, you can replace the Msg/.End sequence
        with a line only saying
        
                PlaceHolder
        
        which will make Announcer just process the next one.
        
        For  the  global  settings  there  are  default  values,  which are
        indicated  in the text below. Default values also exist for some of
        the  message  template  settings, except for "From", "Subj", "File"
        and "Path". These four are vital, and have to be included for every
        message  template  definition.  The  addresses  used in netmail and
        echomail  are  not considered as vital, but without them, you won't
        get any good results.
        
        It  is not of importance whether the keywords are written in upper-
        or lowercase, the only thing you have to keep in mind is that there
        may not be more than one space between the keyword and the data.
        
            Global settings
            ---------------
        
        These are the available global settings:
        
          BinkleyName
        
        This keyword refers to the .PKT mode of Announcer. It is documented
        in the chapter "Creating .PKT files".
        
          BragLineIntro <intro characters for the bragline>
        
        This  defines what should be placed before the bragline. If this is
        not  set  up,  it  will default to "---" (a Fidonet tearline). This
        setting can be a maximum of three characters long.
        
        example:
        BragLineIntro ___
        
          EchoTossLog <file name for the echotoss log file>
        
        If  you  have many echomail areas turned on, but don't write in all
        of  them  at  once,  it's  a  good idea to log which areas you have
        written  to,  and  only  scan  through  these message areas for new
        messages.  This  is why there is an ECHOTOSS.LOG file. It is a text
        file that contains a list of areatags, one on each line. These tags
        specify  the  areas  in  which  new  messages  are  present.  Since
        Announcer  has  the possability to send echomail, it's nice if it's
        able to write to such a file. That's what this keyword is for.
        
        As  a  parameter to this keyword you should specify a full path and
        filename to the file in which the area tags should be added. If the
        file isn't present, it will be created when needed. If the area tag
        already is present in the file, it will not be repeated.
        
        For  this  to  work, you also need to use the keyword "Echo" in the
        message templates. See this keyword.
        
        example:
        EchoTossLog C:\SQUISH\ECHOTOSS.LOG
        
          LogFile <file name for the log file>
        
        If  you  want Announcer to log its actions to a logfile, you should
        enable  this  keyword.  If  the file you specify is not present, it
        will  be  created,  otherwise the new log lines will be appended to
        the end of the file.
        
        example:
        LogFile D:\LOGS\ANNOUNCE.LOG
        
          MsgId <address to use in the MsgId string>
        
        If  you  want  to  create MSGID kludges in local message areas, you
        need  to  specify  which  address  string that should be used. Even
        though  you can write anything (up to 32 characters long), it might
        be  nice  to  stick  to  the specifications, that is that it should
        contain  a "valid return address", and that if the address contains
        a space, it should be placed within quotation mark ("). For netmail
        and  echomail,  MSGID  kludges  will  always  be created, and their
        address  strings  will be created from the originating address. For

          PktPath
          PktPwd
          PktTo
        
        These  five  keywords all refer to the .PKT mode of Announcer. They
        are documented in the chapter "Creating .PKT files".
        
          ReplyKludge <Yes/No>
        
        Tells  Announcer  whether  or  not  to  create REPLY kludges in its
        messages.  If  you don't want to link your postings to the previous
        one, set this to "No". The default is "Yes".
        
        REPLY kludges will not be created in mailing lists.
        
        example:
        ReplyKludge Yes
        
          TagLineFile <file name for the tagline file>
        
        If  you  want  to  use random taglines (taglines are quite commonly
        used in e-mail communities to add a small one liner joke), you need
        to tell Announcer where it can find a file with such things in. The
        tagline  file  you  define can then be used by message *subsequent*
        templates.  It  is  possible  to  change  tagline files between the
        message templates. The new tagline file will then only be available
        to subsequent templates.
        
        All lines that begin with either a semi colon (";") or percent sign
        ("%") will be considered comment lines, and will be ignored.
        
        example:
        TagLineFile D:\BLUEWAVE\DEFAULT.TAG
        
          TagLineIntro <intro characters for taglines>
        
        This defines what should be placed before the tagline (taglines are
        quite  commonly used in e-mail communities to add a small one liner
        joke).  If  this  is not set up, it will default to "..." (which is
        the most common). This setting can be a maximum of three characters
        long.
        
        example:
        TagLineIntro .!.
        
            Message templates
            -----------------
        
        The message templates consist of the following settings:
        
        Please  note  that  the  settings  that  are  marked with a [*] are
        optional.  Some  other  parameters  can  be more or less limited in
        certain  scenarios,  such  things  are  noted  under the individual
        options.
        
          Attributes <message attributes> [*]
        
        With this keyword, you can select what attributes the message to be
        created  shall have. Each attribute is represented by a letter, and
        you  write  the  letter(s) you want in a row after the keyword. You
        can have spaces between the letters if you so wish.
        
        Available attributes are:
          "C": CrashMail
          "K": Kill when sent
          "A": File Attached
          "R": File Request
          "P": Private
          "H": Hold for pickup.
        
        Please  note  that  the  Private status also can be controlled with
        "Private"  (see  this  keyword),  and  that  the flag is ignored in
        netmail  and  echomail.  You  can  not  use specified attributes in
        echomail.

        Attributes CK
        
          Charset <character set> [*]
        
        Here  you can set the character set to be used for the message that
        is to be posted. The message file is always assumed as being stored
        in  PC8,  code  page  437, and conversion will be done according to
        this.  Possible  values  are "PC8" (no conversion will be made, has
        the  same effect as leaving this keyword out), "SV7" (Swedish seven
        bit  code),  "ISO"  (results in ISO 8859-1) or "ASCII" (clean seven
        bit ASCII code, no CHRS-kludge).
        
        You  can also convert your texts to PC8, code page 437, from either
        ISO  8859-1  or  Swedish  seven  bit code. To do this, use the same
        string  as  above,  but  prefixed with a minus sign, i.e "-ISO" for
        conversion from ISO 8559-1 or "-SV7" for Swedish seven bit code.
        
        example:
        Charset ISO
        
          Create <path and file name of semaphore file> [*]
        
        If  you  enter  a  path and file name here, Announcer will create a
        zero-byte semaphore file if the message was posted.
        
        If  you want Announcer to post only if a semaphore file exists, see
        the 'Semaphore' keyword.
        
        example:
        Create C:\ANNOUNCE\POSTED.SEM
        
          Dest <destination address>
        
        With  this  keyword  you can define the destination address for the
        message  that  is to be created. It is only active for netmail, and
        will  be ignored in other cases. If you create netmail messages you
        have  to  specify  both Orig and Dest, otherwise strange things may
        happen, since these values then are undefined.
        
        example:
        Dest 2:204/999.41
        
          Distribution <type of message base> [*]
        
        Here  you  can set what type of message base it is that the message
        will  be  created  in.  Unfortunately,  the  program  has no way of
        automatically  recognize  the  base  type, so you need to set it up
        correctly  here.  If  you don't use this keyword at all, it will be
        considered  as  being  a local area, and the parameters will be set
        that  way. If you want to create netmail or echomail, these message
        base  types  need  to  be set explicity, which can be done by using
        this  keyword  followed by either the text "NetMail" or "EchoMail".
        For local areas, it is optional to use the parameter "Local".
        
        Please note that when you specify NetMail, you also need to specify
        Orig  and  Dest  (see  these  keywords), and that Private (see this
        keyword)  will  not  be  active. If you choose EchoMail you need to
        specify  Orig  (see  this  keyword),  and  that if you want another
        Origin  text  than  "Default  Origin  Line" you also need to define
        Origin (see this keyword). The Private flag will not be active here
        either.
        
        example:
        Distribution NetMail
        
          Echo <area tag> [*]
        
        This  keyword is used in conjunction with EchoTossLog in the global
        settings (see this section) to log in what areas there are messages
        to be sent. If you don't specify both, nothing will happen.
        
        example:
        Echo BLUEWAVE
        
          File <path and filename to be posted>
        
        With  this  keyword  you  specify which file should be used for the
        message body in the created message. The file must exist, otherwise
        the  program  will  abort  with  an error message. If you specify a
        filename  without  a  path,  it will be looked for in the directory
        that is active when the program is started.
        
        example:
        File C:\STAT\WRITERS.TXT
        
          FixedWidth <flag for monospace> [*]
        
        With  FixedWidtth, you can tell wether the message you want to post
        is meant to be shown with a monospaced font or not. Since graphical
        user  interfaces  are  becoming  more  and  more  common even among
        Fidonet  readers,  it  is  also getting more common to read using a
        proportional  typeface,  which,  unfortunately,  makes  tables  and
        similar  look strange. With a monospaced typeface, this problem can
        be cured.
        
        Fixed  Width  uses  a  kludge  line  that  was  first  specified in
        FrontDoor APX/w, namely "FLAGS: NPD".
        Announcer v1.11                                              Page 7

        The default is not to use this kludge.
        
        exempel:
        FixedWidth Yes
        
          Footer <path and filname for footer file> [*]
        
        This keyword specifies a footer file, which will be added after the
        "big"  file.  It  can  be  a  signature  file, or something in that
        direction. If you don't give any, no footer file will be used.
        
        No error message will be shown if the file does not exist.
        
        example:
        Footer C:\SIG\MY.SIG
        
          From <sender name>
        
        Here the sender name for the message to be created is specified. If
        the  message  base format does not restrict it further, the maximum
        length  of  the  name is 35 characters, if you enter a name that is
        too long, it will be truncated to fit the maximum length.
        
        example:
        From Statistiscs Generator
        
          Header <path and file name header file> [*]
        
        This  keyword  specifies  a header file, which will be added before
        the  "big"  file.  It  can be a logotype file, or something in that
        direction. If you don't give any, no header file will be used.
        
        No error message will be shown if the file does not exist.
        
        example:
        Header C:\LOGOS\MY.LGO
        
          Interval <interval> [*]
          Interval @<posting date> [*]
        
        If you don't want the message to be posted everytime the program is
        run, you can enter an interval, given as a number of days, here. If
        you  run  Announcer each day of the week, and have the interval set
        to  7,  a  message  will  only be posted once a week anyway. If you
        don't give an interval, or an interval of zero, the message will be
        posted each time the program is run.
        
        You may also tell Announcer only to post messages on certain dates,
        then  prefix  the  date with an at sign ("@"). Please note that you
        actually need to run Announcer on that date, if you don't, it won't
        be posted until next month.
        
        You  can't use the two variants of the Interval keyword together in
        the same message template.
        
        example:
        Interval 14
        Interval @1
        
          MinSize <no. of bytes> [*]
        
        With  this  optional  keyword, you can specify the minimum size the
        message  file must have for it to be posted. If the file is smaller
        than  this  amount, including the file not existing, it will not be
        posted.
        
        This  can  also  be  used to only post messages if the message file
        exists,  (if  it  doesn't,  it  is  considered too small), just use
        MinSize 0. (To do this, you might also use Semaphore).
        
        example:
        MinSize 1024
        
          Orig <originating address>
        
        With this keyword you enter the originating address for the message
        that  shall  be created. It is only active in netmail and echomail,
        and  will be otherwised ignored. The address you enter here will be
        used  to  create  a MSGID kludge. (MSGID will always be created for
        netmail and echomail).
        
        Page 8                                              Announcer v1.11

        example:
        Orig 2:204/999.42
        
          Origin <origin line> [*]
        
        This  is  an  optional  keyword  which  only is active when you are
        creating  echomail,  and it is used to specify the text that should
        be  used  on the Origin line. Origin lines will always be createdm,
        even  if  you  haven't  specified any text, but it might be nice to
        have your own text here.
        
        Since  the Fidonet specifications says that an Origin line can be a
        maximum  of  79  characters, including the prefix " * Origin: " and
        the  suffix " (address)", you cannot enter a line that is too long.
        The  line will be truncated from the right if that is the case. How
        long  precisely  your  text can be depends on how long your address
        is.  There is room for more text if you have the address 7:7/7 than
        999:999/999.999
        
        example:
        Origin My spot in the universe
        
          Path <path to the message base>
        
        In  order for Announcer to know where the message should be posted,
        you need to tell it what message base should be used. The format of
        this  path  depends  on the format of the message base according to
        the table below:
        
        Squish:  The  letter  "S"  followed by the path to the message base
        stemfile (without extension).
        example:
        Path SC:\MAX\MSG\MUFFIN
        
        Hudson:  The  letter "H" followed by a three-digit, decimal, number
        that  specifies  the  area number, and this in its turn followed by
        the directory in which the message base resides.
        example:
        Path H007C:\RA\MSG\MSGBASE
        
        Fido  (*.MSG): The letter "F" followed by the path to the directory
        in which the message base resides.
        example:
        Path FC:\FD\NET\
        
        JAM:  The  letter  "J"  followed  by  the  path to the message base
        stemfile (without extension).
        example:
        Path JC:\RA2\MSG\RA_UTIL
        
        EzyCom  (before version 1.10 of EzyCom): The letter "E" followed by
        a  for-digit,  decimal,  number that specifies the area number, and
        this  in  its turn followed by the path to the messagebase (without
        extension).
        example:
        Path E0001F:\EZY\MSG
        
          Private <private flag>
        
        This keyword tells whether the message that is to be posted will be
        private  or  not. You should enter "Yes" if it should be private or
        "No"  if  it is to be seen by everyone. Please notice that when you
        write  echomail,  it will automatically be seen by everyone, and if
        you  write  netmail,  it  will automatically be private, so in both
        these cases, this keyword is not needed.
        
        example:
        Private Yes
        
          Semaphore <path and file name of semaphore file> [*]
        
        With this keyword you can control the posting of the message with a
        so  called semaphore file. If the specified file does not exist, no
        message will be created. Semaphore files are generally 0 byte files
        that  are  created  by a program to signal that a certain situation
        has  occured.  An  example  is that a new user has logged in at the
        BBS. The semaphore file is not removed by Announcer.
        
        This  can  also  be  used to only post messages if the message file
        exists  (otherwise  Announcer will give an error message), just use
        the  same file name for the semaphore file as for the message file.
        (To do this, you might also use MinSize).
        
        If  you  want  Announcer  to  create a semaphore if the message was
        posted, see the 'Create' keyword.
        
        exemple:
        Semaphore c:\timed\netmail.sem
        
          Split <number of parts> [*]
          Split @<maximum part size> [*]
        Announcer v1.11                                              Page 9
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

        If  the message file you want to post is large, and not all message
        processors  on  the  way to the destination are able to handle such
        large  messages,  you  can  use  this  keyword to split it into any
        number of parts you wish.
        
        It  is  also  possible  to  give  the maximum allowed size that the
        resulting message may have, in that case you should prefix the byte
        count with an at sign ("@"). The size does not include the kludges.
        The messages are still divided evenly.
        
        When  posting to Squish databases, the routines used do not support
        messages  larger  than  approximately  33,000  characters.  If  you
        specify  larger  parts, even if it's because you're leaving out the
        Split  keyword, the message will be splitted so that each part will
        not exceed 33,000 characters.
        
        If  you  want  the  originating  address  in the SPLIT kludge to be
        correct,  you  have  to  give  an  Orig  address,  even  for  local
        messages.
        
        You can't use the two variants of the Split keyword together in the
        same message template.
        
        example:
        Split 2
        Split @10000
        
          Subject <subject line>
        
        Here the subject line of the message to be created is specified. If
        the  message  base does not restrict it further, the maximum length
        of  the  subject line is 75 characters, if you enter a subject that
        is too long, it will be truncated to fit the maximum length.
        
        example:
        Subject Top ten message writers
        
          TagLine <the tagline that should be used> [*]
        
        With  this keyword you determine whether a tagline will be added to
        the  message  or not. If you don't specify this keyword, no tagline
        will  be used. You can also set it up so that the same tagline will
        be  used  every  time  (a static tagline), or if it is to vary each
        time  by reading randomly from the file you have specified with the
        keyword TagLineFile in the global settings (see this section).
        
        If you want the same tagline to be used every time you can give the
        tagline  text  after the keyword (a maximum length of 80 characters
        is  allowed),  and if you want it to be choosen at random, you only
        enter a commercial at sign ("@").
        
        example:
        TagLine @
        
          To <receiver name> [*]
          To @<name of mailing list file> [*]
        
        Here  the  receiver name of the message to be created is specified.
        If  the  message  base  does  not  restrict it further, the maximum
        length  of  the receiver name is 35 characters, if you enter a name
        that  is  too long, it will be truncated to fit the maximum length.
        If you don't enter any name, the receiver field will be empty.
        
        If  you wish to create a mailing list (ie. post the same message to
        several  people),  you  should  enter  a  commercial  at sign ("@")
        followed  by  the name of the file that contains all the recipients
        in  the  mailing  list  instead  of  the  receiver  name. This file
        contains lines with receiver address and receiver name separated by
        a  space.  For  more  information,  see  the chapter "Using mailing
        lists".
        
        You  can't  use  the two variants of the To keyword together in the
        same message template.
        
        example:
        To All
        To @MYLIST.TXT
        
          UpdatedSend <updatingflag>
        
        With  this  keyword  you can select whether the message file should
        only  be  posted  if it has been updated since the last posting. If
        you  select  "Yes",  the file date will be checked against the last
        posting  date,  and if it is older, the message will not be posted.
        If you select "No", no such checking will be made.
        
        example:
        UpdatedSend Yes
        
                The %1 and %2 variables
                ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
        
        To  make  it  easier  to  post messages to different people without
        having  to edit the configuration file each time, it is possible to
        enter  two  parameters  on  the  command line. These parameters are
        meant  to  be used as the sender and/or receiver names, but you can
        use  them as easily for subject lines, file names, receiver address
        in  netmail,  and  all  the other settings that are included in the
        message templates.
        
        To  use the parameters you pass on the command line, you should use
        the  "%1"  and "%2" variables in the configuration file. These will
        then  be  exchanged  with the parameters you entered. If you want a
        space in the name, these must be exchanged with an underscore ("_")
        on the command line.

        Example:  We  want  to send a welcoming message to new BBS members,
        and  want  a  special  configuration  file that we can use at those
        times. Then a combination of the /I parameter (for more information
        on  this  parameter,  please  look  at  the  chapter  "Command line
        format"),  name  on the command line and variables are a good thing
        to  have.  Let's  say  that  we  define  the  message  templates as
        follows:
        
            MSG
            File NEWUSER.TXT
            Subject New user - welcome
            To %1
            From Sysopus Anonymous
            Path SC:\MAX\MSG\SYSOP
            Tagline My little BBS - for you and me
            Private Yes
            .end
        
        If  we name the configuration file NEWUSER.INI, and want to welcome
        a person called John Doe, we enter this at the command line:
        
            ANNOUNCE /INEWUSER.INI John_Doe
        
        %1  on  the  To line will then be exchanged for "John Doe", and the
        message will look like this:
        
            From: Sysopus Anonymous             (private)
            To:   John Doe
            Subj: New user - welcome
            =============================================
            ..contens of the file newuser.txt..
        
            ... My little BBS - for you and me
        
        If  you  forget  to enter a name on the command line, the variables
        will be exchanged for "Announcer", and the message above would have
        been posted to Announcer.
        
                Using mailing lists
                ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
        
        Mailing  lists  are  a  convenient way to post the same messages to
        several  poople  at once. Say for example that you're the head of a
        local  computer  club,  and  you  want to netmail its member with a
        bulletin  each  month.  Posting  individual messages, or setting up
        Announcer  with one template for each receiver is tedious, the easy
        way out is to set up a mailing list.
        
        To tell Announcer that it is a mailing liss you want to do, and not
        a  normal  mail, you need to create a file containing all the names
        and  addresses, and point to that file in the message template. The
        format  of  the  mailing  list  file  is straightforward, each line
        contains  the  address  of the recipient, followed by the name, the
        two  fields  separated  with  a  single  space.  For  Announcer  to
        understand  that  it  is a list of names it should look for, prefix
        the file name at the To keyword with a commercial at sign ("@").
        
        Announcer  will  identify  messages  posted  to  a  mailing list by
        inserting  a  special  kludge  "NOTE",  which shows the name of the
        mailing  list  file.  If  you want to change this to something more
        descriptive,  enter  the  name  you  want  on the first line of the
        mailing list file, prefixed with a semi colon (";").
        
        Example, a computer club newsletter:
        
        First,  we  create a file "NEWSLTR.LST", which contains the list of
        the recipients (only two people in this example):
        
            ;Computer Newsletter
            7:342/169.31 John Doe
            8:412/961.17 Jane Doe
        
        Then  we  set up a message template that points to the mailing list
        file:
        
            Msg
            File NEWSLTR.TXT
            Subject Computer Club X Newsletter
            To @NEWSLTR.LST
            From Bill Doe
            Orig 7:342/117
            Path JC:\RA2\NETMAIL
            Distribution Netmail
            .end
        Announcer v1.11                                             Page 11
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

        This  setup  will result in these two message (only header and NOTE
        kludge is shown in this example):
        
            From: Bill Doe (7:342/117)
            To:   John Doe (7:342/169.31)
            Subj: Computer Club X Newsletter
            =============================================
            ^aNOTE: Mailing list "Computer Newsletter"
            ...
        
            From: Bill Doe (7:342/117)
            To:   Jane Doe (8:412/961.17)
            Subj: Computer Club X Newsletter
            =============================================
            ^aNOTE: Mailing list "Computer Newsletter"
            ...
        
        Since  only  one  MSGID  is  recorded  for  each template, no REPLY
        kludges  will  be  created  for mailing lists, even if you have set
        "ReplyKludge Yes" in global configuration.
        
        Please note that it is not possible to combine the two forms of the
        To  keyword.  Furthermore,  if the message file is not found, the @
        sign will be considered a part of the receiver name, which makes it
        possible  to post to someone that has a @ as the first character of
        the name.
        
                Creating .PKT files
                ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
        
        Announcer  has  the  capability  of directly creating type "2+" PKT
        file  (mail  bundles). This is called ".PKT mode". The operation of
        Announcer  differs slightly from how it normally works, and this is
        why it is covered in its own chapter.
        
        To  initiate .PKT mode, you need to define the four global keywords
        "PktMode",  "PktPath",  "PktFrom"  and  "PktTo". If you omit any of
        them,  Announcer  will  have  trouble operating, but due to the way
        Announcer  processes the configuration file, it will not abort with
        an  error  message. The two keywords "PktPwd" and "BinkleyName" are
        optional.  Here follows detailed descriptions of these six keywords
        (alphabetically):
        
          BinkleyName <Yes/No> [optional]
        
        With  this  option  set to "Yes", you instruct Announcer to use the
        BinkleyTerm   name   style,   "aaaabbbb.OUT",  where  aaaa  is  the
        destination  net  number in hexadecimal and bbbb is the destination
        node  number, also in hexadecimal. With this, you do not need to go
        through  any other message processing software to send a message in
        conjunction with a Binkley-style mailer.
        
        BinkleyName  defaults  to  "No",  which  yields  a  packet  name of
        "nnnnnnnn.PKT",  where  nnnnnnnn  is  the  number  of seconds since
        January  1st  1970  (Unix time) written in hexadecimal. This is the
        same type of number that is used for the MSGIDs.
        
        If  the  PKT  file  that Announcer tries to write to should already
        exist,  Announcer will append the messages in the end. The contents
        of the PKT file's header will not be changed.
        
        example:
        BinkleyName Yes
        
          PktFrom <originating address>
        
        This  keyword  specifies  the originating address of the .PKT file.
        This  is  generally  the same address as the originating address of
        the messages contained in the packets.
        
        example:
        PktFrom 2:204/145.42
        
          PktMode <temporary path for .MSG files>
        
        PktMode is the "magic" keyword that puts Announcer in .PKT mode. It
        also  defines  the  path  to  put  Announcer's temporary .MSG files
        (Announcer will not directly create the .PKT file, but will instead
        create  one  .MSG  file  for each message, in the directory defined
        here. These messages will then be packed into the .PKT file).
        
        All  files  with  the extension .MSG will be removed from this path
        when  Announcer is done. Announcer will add ALL .MSG files that are
        found in this directory, not only the ones it has created itself.
        
        example:
        PktMode C:\TEMP
        
          PktPath <directory to put the .PKT file in>
        
        Page 12                                             Announcer v1.11
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

        This keyword specifies the directory in which the .PKT file will be
        created.
        
        example:
        PktPath C:\BINKLEY\INBOUND
        
          PktPwd <password in .PKT file> [optional]
        
        With  this  optional  keyword,  you  can  specify  a password to be
        inserted into the .PKT file.
        
        example:
        PktPwd SECRET
        
          PktTo <destination address>
        
        This  keyword specifies the .PKT file's destination address. It may
        be the same as the originating address.
        
        example:
        PktTo 2:204/145.0
        
        Please  note,  that  the  keyword  "EchoTossLog" has no effect when
        Announcer is in .PKT mode.
        
        In  addition  to  these  changes  in the global section, some minor
        changes apply to the message templates:
        
          Distribution <type of message area>
        
        This   keyword  is  mandatory  in  .PKT  mode.  Also,  the  "Local"
        distribution  method  is not valid in this mode. Only "NetMail" and
        "EchoMail" can be used.
        
        example:
        Distribution EchoMail
        
          Echo <echotag>
        
        This  keyword is mandatory for writing echomail in .PKT mode, since
        the  echotag  must  be  known.  It  is not used for an EchoToss.Log
        file.
        
        example:
        Echo ISDN.EUR
        
        The "Path" keyword can not be used in .PKT mode. It will abort with
        an error message. Since all .MSG files are created in the temporary
        directory, there is no need to specify an alternative path.
        
        It  should  also  be  noted  that  .PKT mode and normal mode can be
        combined  in one configuration file, but only in a limited fashion.
        Once .PKT mode is initiated, you can't turn it off. It is also only
        possible  to  create  one  .PKT file per configuration file. If you
        enter  a  new  PktMode keyword, the previous one will be discarded,
        and the .PKT file will be created from the newly defined directory.
        The same applies to the PktPath keyword.
        
        To  combine  normal  and .PKT mode, the configuration can look like
        this:
        
            LogFile C:\ANNOUNCE\ANNOUNCE.LOG
        
            ; This message is posted in normal mode, in a

            ; Now, we initiate .PKT mode

        This  program can run in both Swedish and English. The program will
        check  your  country  setting  (COUNTRY  in  CONFIG.SYS)  and  will
        automatically set to Swedish if you live in Sweden, Norway, Denmark
        or  Finland, and otherwise to English. To override this setting you
        should  use the environment variable ANNLANG. It can have either of
        these two values:
        
            SWE    Swedish
            ENG    English
        
        You set it up with the command SET, for example:
        
            SET ANNLANG=ENG
        
        will  set  the language to English. If you want to set the language
        automatically when you start your computer, you can enter that line
        into your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

        I would like to thank the beta testers, Peter Korkala (a.k.a PKaze)

        finding  bug  and  coming  up  with  new features! Without you this

        Thanks also to Carl Olofsson and Leif T Andresson for the help with
        ideas on how to read a random line from a file.
