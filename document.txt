        {Quick start} (or what you really should know)
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Announcer is completely controlled from the command line and its configuration file (see their respective chapters). There is no interactive part, which makes it easy to set the program up to automatically post files. This also implies that you need to know a bit about how the program is controlled before it's usable. I therefor recommend you to read through the two chapters "Command line format" and "The configuration file", or at least the remarks in the sample configuration file that comes with the program. This will save you a great deal of work.

If you want to use the standard settings that exist for Announcer, you simply enter

        ANNOUNCE

at the command line, and the program will execute. It will now use the standard configuration file ANNOUNCE.INI and do what is told there. If any errors occur, they will be printed on the screen, and the program execution will end. A common error is that files or message bases are missing, which mostly is caused by misspelled file names, but it can also be caused by the file or message base being locked by another program.

If you wish to use the settings of another configuration file, read the chapter titled "Command line format". If you want to use the possibility to specify sender and receiver names on the command line, see the chapter "The % variables". If you want a more detailed description on how the configuration file is structured, see the chapter "ANNOUNCE.INI, the configuration file". See also the examples in the included sample configuration file.

And if you want to learn everything, read this manual through carefully and memorize it :-)

I also would like you to read the chapter "Status", which includes information on how to pay for the program.

        {Background}
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

I originally wrote this program for a local BBS, where I and a couple of my friends "competed" on who could write the most messages, and since I don't like to be on-line, I downloaded the mail and read it off-line. The problem then was that I was not able to check the statistics when I was offline, and that I always forgot to check it when I was on-line.

So, therefore I wrote this program, initially a very limited one, but as the beta testers and I personally came up with new ideas, the program grown out of this limited version to what it now is. It is now able to do more than only post top-ten-lists, it can post welcoming messages to new users, conference rules in echomail areas, automatic reminders, and much more. Your imagination is the limit (okay, so long as it is inside the program's area. It won't operate your microwave oven).

ANNOUNCE [/I[drive:][path]filename] [/D[M]] [/P] [/Q] [/S]
         [/F[A]] [/L] [names ...]
ANNOUNCE /?

  /I[drive:][path]filename

This parameter tells Announcer that it is to use another configuration file than ANNOUNCE.INI, which is the default (unless you have changed the name of the executable file, Announcer uses the name and path of this file to create the name of the default configuration file, so if you have changed the program name to A.EXE, the default configuration file name will be A.INI).

  /D

This option will tell Announcer not to post messages, but instead show status information. What is shown is the time that have passed since the messages have been posted, the intervals that have been specified for the messages (if any), the wanted minimum size, the existence of a semaphore file, and the MSGID that were used at the last posting. Please notice that you need to have run Announcer at least once to be able to use this command line switch.

  the M modifier (/DM)

This modifier to the /D parameter will get Announcer to clean up the data file, so that items that are in the file and that does not match any message template in the configuration file will be removed. This is useful when message templates have been deleted from the data file. It can only be used together with /D, and will otherwise be ignored.

Please note that if the data file and the templates get "out of sync", for example if you delete a template somewhere in the middle, you cannot use /M, but have to use the special PlaceHolder token instead. /M will though zero out entries that are defined as "PlaceHolder"s.

  /P

When specifying this command line parameter, Announcer will not create tear lines in the messages it creates, but instead shows its name in a PID kludge. When posting echomail to message bases, this command line option will also result in Announcer not adding an Origin line, leaving that to the tosser. When in .PKT mode, an Origin line will be created, but no tear line.

Please note that the tosser TerMail, at least in some versions, do not add a tear and Origin line when tossing, so this option will then generate invalid messages according to the Fidonet specifications. Use with caution.

  /Q

This command line option will inhibit Announcer from showing any output, except for error messages, which are always printed to the stderr device. Normally all output is written to the device connected to stdout (usually the screen). May not be used together with the /FA option.

  /S

Use this command line option to simulate a run by Announcer. Announcer will do everything like if it has been a real run, except that it won't create the messages or semaphores, it won't log anything to the log file (it is instead logged to the screen), and the data file is not updated. This can be useful for debugging configuration files.

  /F

This command line option is used to force posting of messages even though the requirements for their posting aren't met (because of, e.g. interval or minimum file size).

  the A modifier (/FA)

If you use /F all messages will be posted, while /FA asks for posting for each template. /FA cannot be used together with /Q.

  /L

If you enter the /L parameter, Announcer will not update the latest posting date for the messages that are posted (the latest used MSGID will be updated, though). This can be useful for e.g. posting updated rule files directly when they are changed, together with /FA, without disturbing interval driver postings, but still get them into the same reply chain.

  names

These texts will be use wherever you enter %1 to %10 (the number corresponding to the ordering on the command line), in the configuration file. They may be used to make it possible to post a standardized message to different people. If you want a space in the name you should change it to an underscore character ("_"). If you supply less than ten names, the remaining %n variables will evaluate as "Announcer". These names have no effect when used together with /D.

  /?

Displays the quick help screen.

        {ANNOUNCE.INI, the configuration file}
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

The configuration file, default name ANNOUNCE.INI, tells Announcer what it is supposed to do, and in what way it should be done. To use Announcer, a configuration file is a must, and to use Announcer's functions I recommend you to read through this chapter. Some explanations are also included in the sample configuration file that comes with the distribution archive.

If you want comments in the file you can enter them on lines that have a semi colon (";") in the left-hand position.

By default, Announcer will look for a configuration file that is placed in the same directory as the program, and that has the same name, except that the file type is .INI. Remember that if you change the program name, if you change it to A.EXE, the configuration file name will default to A.INI.

For each configuration file, a data file, with the file type .DAT, will be created. This file contains information on latest posting date, used by the interval handling, as well as the MSGID that was used, so that the next posting can contain a REPLY kludge. (If you have "ReplyKludge No" set, no REPLY kludge will be created, but the MSGID will still be logged).

The configuration file contains two different "areas", the first one is the global area where you define default settings for all massages, and the second area is the individual settings for each message that is to be created. The settings that are used in the two areas are completely different, but they have influence on each other.

Each message template begins with a line that has the only word

        Msg

on it, and is ended with the text

        .End

Between these lines the configuration posts that are needed for the message are placed, and outside these the global settings can be set. Note that there is no requirement on the ordering of the different settings.

If you wish Announcer to skip over a message template, e.g. if you remove one in the middle, you can replace the Msg/.End sequence with a line only saying

        PlaceHolder

which will make Announcer just process the next one.

For the global settings there are default values, which are indicated in the text below. Default values also exist for some of the message template settings, except for "From", "Subj", "File" and "Path". These four are vital, and have to be included for every message template definition. The addresses used in netmail and echomail are not considered as vital, but without them, you won't get any good results.

It is not of importance whether the keywords are written in upper- or lowercase. If you wish to have spaces included in the beginning or end of the data, you have to surround the value with quotation marks (").

  {  Global settings}
    ---------------

These are the available global settings:

  BinkleyName

This keyword refers to the .PKT mode of Announcer. It is documented in the chapter "Creating .PKT files".

  BragLineIntro <intro characters for the brag-line>

This defines what should be placed before the brag-line. If this is not set up, it will default to "---" (a Fidonet tearline). This setting can be a maximum of three characters long.

example:
BragLineIntro ___

  EchoTossLog <file name for the echotoss log file>

If you have many echomail areas turned on, but don't write in all of them at once, it's a good idea to log which areas you have written to, and only scan through these message areas for new messages. This is why there is an ECHOTOSS.LOG file. It is a text file that contains a list of area tags, one on each line. These tags specify the areas in which new messages are present. Since Announcer has the possibility to send echomail, it's nice if it's able to write to such a file. That's what this keyword is for.

As a parameter to this keyword you should specify a full path and filename to the file in which the area tags should be added. If the file isn't present, it will be created when needed. If the area tag already is present in the file, it will not be repeated.

For this to work, you also need to use the keyword "Echo" in the message templates. See this keyword. See also "JamTossLog" below.

example:
EchoTossLog C:\SQUISH\ECHOTOSS.LOG

  FMailCfg <path and filename for FMail.Cfg>

Makes Announcer read FMail's (version 1.22) configuration file, so that one does not need to specify the paths to all message areas. Announcer will only read the FMAIL.CFG and FMAIL.AR files.

example:
FMailCfg C:\FMAIL\FMAIL.CFG

  GEchoCfg <path and filename for GEcho.Cfg>

Makes Announcer read GEcho's (version 1.20) configuration file, so that one does not need to specify the paths to all message areas. Announcer will only read the GECHO.CFG and AREAFILE.GE files.

example:
GEchoCfg C:\GECHO\GECHO.CFG

  IdServer <directory for the IDServer file>
  IdServer No

According to the MSGID kludge specifications, the MSGID numbers that are generated should be unique for three years. With one program this is easy to handle, but with more than one it can be hard. IDServer was creaated to avoid this problem. An IDServer is a small data file that contains the next free MSGID number (and a few other things). By using this in all programs that are used, all the programs will create unique MSGID codes.

IDServer can be specified either via the environment variable IDSERVER or via this configuration option. If you have the environment variable IDSERVER set, and, by any reason, do not want Announcer to use this setting, you can specify the parameter "NO". The IDServer will then not be used.

example:
IDServer C:\

  JamTossLog <path to echomail.jam/netmail.jam>

If you are using JAM areas, ECHOTOSS.LOG (see EchoTossLog above) is normally not used, but instead the files ECHOMAIL.JAM and NETMAIL.JAM. To create them, use this keyword.

As a parameter to this keyword you should specify the path to the directory in which the files are to be written. In the file, the database path and the message numbers will be logged, so it is not necessary to use "Echo".

If you have both EchoTossLog and JamTossLog defined, both will be used, but not simultaneously. JamTossLog will be used for JAM areas, and EchoTossLog for the others. If you do not use JamTossLog, but do have EchoTossLog, JAM areas will be logged in the EchoTossLog.

example:
JamTossLog C:\FASTECHO\

  LogFile <file name for the log file>

If you want Announcer to log its actions to a log file, you should enable this keyword. If the file you specify is not present, it will be created, otherwise the new log lines will be appended to the end of the file.

example:
LogFile D:\LOGS\ANNOUNCE.LOG

  MsgId <address to use in the MsgId string>

If you want to create MSGID kludges in local message areas, you need to specify which address string that should be used. Even though you can write anything (up to 32 characters long), it might be nice to stick to the specifications, that is that it should contain a "valid return address", and that if the address contains a space, it should be placed within quotation mark ("). For netmail and echomail, MSGID kludges will always be created, and their address strings will be created from the originating address. For such messages, this keyword serves no purpose.

example:
MsgId 999:42/417.25@MyNet

  NetMailTearLine <Yes/No>

Controls whether or not you want a tearline in netmail messages or not. Please note that the PID kludge control (the /P command line option) has precedence to this setting. The default value is that tearlines are used in netmail.

example:
NetMailTearLine No

  PktFrom
  PktMode
  PktPath
  PktPwd
  PktTo

These five keywords all refer to the .PKT mode of Announcer. They are documented in the chapter "Creating .PKT files".

  ReplyKludge <Yes/No>

Tells Announcer whether or not to create REPLY kludges in its messages. If you don't want to link your postings to the previous one, set this to "No". The default is "Yes".

REPLY kludges will not be created in mailing lists.

example:
ReplyKludge Yes

  SquishCfg <path and filename for Squish.Cfg>

Makes Announcer read SquishMail's (version 1.11) configuration file, so that one does not need to specify the paths to all message areas.

example:
SquishCfg C:\SQUISH\SQUISH.CFG

  TagLineFile <file name for the tagline file>

If you want to use random taglines (taglines are quite commonly used in e-mail communities to add a small one liner joke), you need to tell Announcer where it can find a file with such things in. The tagline file you define can then be used by message *subsequent* templates. It is possible to change tagline files between the message templates. The new tagline file will then only be available to subsequent templates.

All lines that begin with either a semi colon (";") or percent sign ("%") will be considered comment lines, and will be ignored.

example:
TagLineFile D:\BLUEWAVE\DEFAULT.TAG

  TagLineIntro <intro characters for taglines>

This defines what should be placed before the tagline (taglines are quite commonly used in e-mail communities to add a small one liner joke). If this is not set up, it will default to "..." (which is the most common). This setting can be a maximum of three characters long.

example:
TagLineIntro .!.

  TerMailCfg <path and filename for Tm.Cfg>

Makes Announcer read TermMail's (version 3.0-5.0) configuration file, so that one does not need to specify the paths to all message areas.

Please note that if you are using relative paths in your area list, you need to difine an absolute Terminate path in Tm.Cfg (keyword 'TERMINATE').

example:
TerMailCfg C:\TERMINAT\TERMAIL\TM.CFG

  {  Message templates}
    -----------------

The message templates consist of the following settings:

Please note that the settings that are marked with a [*] symbol are optional. Some other parameters might be more or less limited in certain scenarios, such things are noted under the individual options.

  Attributes <message attributes> [*]

With this keyword, you can select what attributes the message to be created shall have. Each attribute is represented by a letter, and you write the letter(s) you want in a row after the keyword. You can have spaces between the letters if you so wish.

Available attributes are:
  "C": CrashMail
  "K": Kill when sent
  "A": File Attached
  "R": File Request
  "P": Private
  "H": Hold for pickup.

Please note that the Private status also can be controlled with "Private" (see this keyword), and that the flag is ignored in netmail and echomail. You cannot use specified attributes in echomail.

example:
Attributes CK

  Charset <character set> [*]

Here you can set the character set to be used for the message that is to be posted. The message file is always assumed as being stored in PC8, code page 437, and conversion will be done according to this. Possible values are "PC8" (no conversion will be made, has the same effect as leaving this keyword out), "SV7" (Swedish seven bit code), "ISO" (results in ISO 8859-1) or "ASCII" (clean seven bit ASCII code, no CHRS-kludge).

You can also convert your texts to PC8, code page 437, from either ISO 8859-1 or Swedish seven bit code. To do this, use the same string as above, but prefixed with a minus sign, i.e "-ISO" for conversion from ISO 8559-1 or "-SV7" for Swedish seven bit code.

If you enter "-ASCII", conversion will be made from ASCII with parity to ASCII without parity (i.e. the high bit in the characters will be zeroed).

If you have got a text that is in either Swedish seven bit code or ISO 8859-1, and want to post it in that character set, you can use the same strings as above, but prefixed with a plus sign, i.e "+ISO" for files in ISO 8859-1 or "+SV7" for Swedish seven bit code. The configuration file data should still be in PC8, as conversion will be done based on this presumption.

example:
Charset ISO

  Create <path and file name of semaphore file> [*]

If you enter a path and file name here, Announcer will create a zero-byte semaphore file if the message were posted.

If you want Announcer to post only if a semaphore file exists, see the 'Semaphore' keyword.

example:
Create C:\ANNOUNCE\POSTED.SEM

  Dest <destination address>

With this keyword you can define the destination address for the message that is to be created. It is only active for netmail, and will be ignored in other cases. If you create netmail messages you have to specify both Orig and Dest, otherwise strange things may happen, since these values then are undefined.

example:
Dest 2:204/999.41

  Distribution <type of message base> [*]

Here you can set what type of message base it is that the message will be created in. Unfortunately, the program has no way of automatically recognize the base type, so you need to set it up correctly here. If you don't use this keyword at all, it will be considered as being a local area, and the parameters will be set that way. If you want to create netmail or echomail, these message base types need to be set explicitly, which can be done by using this keyword followed by either the text "NetMail" or "EchoMail". For local areas, it is optional to use the parameter "Local".

Please note that when you specify NetMail, you also need to specify Orig and Dest (see these keywords), and that Private (see this keyword) will not be active. If you choose EchoMail you need to specify Orig (see this keyword), and that if you want another Origin text than "Default Origin Line" you also need to define Origin (see this keyword). The Private flag will not be active here either.

The area type is automatically determined if you are importing a tosser configuration, and uses the area tag to find an area.

example:
Distribution NetMail

  Echo <area tag> [*]

This keyword is used in conjunction with EchoTossLog in the global settings (see this section) to log in what areas there are messages to be sent. If you don't specify both, nothing will happen.

If you are importing a tosser configuration, and leave out the Path keyword, the area will be looked up using this tag. It need not then be an echomail area.

example:
Echo BLUEWAVE

  File <path and filename to be posted>

With this keyword you specify the file to be used as message body in the created message. The file must exist, otherwise the program will abort with an error message. If you specify a filename without a path, it will be looked for in the directory that is active when the program is started.

example:
File C:\STAT\WRITERS.TXT

  FixedWidth <flag for monospace> [*]

With FixedWidth, you can tell whether the message you want to post is meant to be shown with a monospaced font or not. Since graphical user interfaces are becoming more and more common even among Fidonet readers, it is also getting more common to read using a proportional typeface, which, unfortunately, makes tables and similar look strange. With a monospaced typeface, this problem can be cured.

Fixed Width uses a kludge line that was first specified in FrontDoor APX/w, namely "FLAGS: NPD".

The default is not to use this kludge.

example:
FixedWidth Yes

  Footer <path and filename for footer file> [*]

This keyword specifies a footer file, which will be added after the "big" file. It can be a signature file, or something in that direction. If you don't give any, no footer file will be used.

No error message will be shown if the file does not exist.

example:
Footer C:\SIG\MY.SIG

  From <sender name>

Here the sender name for the message to be created is specified. If the message base format does not restrict it further, the maximum length of the name is 35 characters, if you enter a name that is too long, it will be truncated to fit the maximum length.

example:
From Statistics Generator

  Header <path and file name header file> [*]

This keyword specifies a header file, which will be added before the "big" file. It can be a logotype file, or something in that direction. If you don't give any, no header file will be used.

No error message will be shown if the file does not exist.

example:
Header C:\LOGOS\MY.LGO

  Interval <interval> [*]
  Interval @<posting date> [*]

If you don't want the message to be posted every time the program is run, you can enter an interval, given as a number of days, here. If you run Announcer each day of the week, and have the interval set to 7, a message will only be posted once a week anyway. If you don't give an interval, or an interval of zero, the message will be posted each time the program is run.

You may also tell Announcer only to post messages on certain dates, then prefix the date with an at sign ("@"). Please note that you actually need to run Announcer on that date, if you don't, it won't be posted until next month.

You can't use the two variants of the Interval keyword together in the same message template.

example:
Interval 14
Interval @1

  MinSize <no. of bytes> [*]

With this optional keyword, you can specify the minimum size the message file must have for it to be posted. If the file is smaller than this amount, including the file not existing, it will not be posted.

This can also be used to post messages only if the message file exists, (if it doesn't, it is considered too small), just use MinSize 0. (To do this, you might also use Semaphore).

example:
MinSize 1024

  Orig <originating address>

With this keyword you enter the originating address for the message that shall be created. It is only active in netmail and echomail, and will be ignorde otherwise. The address you enter here will be used to create a MSGID kludge. (MSGID will always be created for netmail and echomail).

The originating address is automatically determined if you are importing a tosser configuration, and uses the area tag to find an area.

example:
Orig 2:204/999.42

  Origin <origin line> [*]

This is an optional keyword that is only active when you are creating echomail messages, and it is used to specify the text that should be used on the Origin line. Origin lines will always be created, even if you haven't specified any text, but it might be nice to have your own text here.

Since the Fidonet specifications says that an Origin line can be a maximum of 79 characters, including the prefix " * Origin: " and the suffix " (address)", you cannot enter a line that is too long. The line will be truncated from the right if that is the case. Precisely how long your text can be depends on how long your address is. There is room for more text if you have the address 7:7/7 than 999:999/999.999

example:
Origin My spot in the universe

  Path <path to the message base>

In order for Announcer to know where the message should be posted, you need to tell it what message base should be used. The format of this path depends on the format of the message base according to the table below:

Squish: The letter "S" followed by the path to the message base stem file (without extension).
example:
Path SC:\MAX\MSG\MUFFIN

Hudson: The letter "H" followed by a three-digit, decimal, number that specifies the area number, and this in its turn followed by the directory in which the message base resides.
example:
Path H007C:\RA\MSG\MSGBASE

Fido (*.MSG): The letter "F" followed by the path to the directory in which the message base resides.
example:
Path FC:\FD\NET\

JAM: The letter "J" followed by the path to the message base stem file (without extension).
example:
Path JC:\RA2\MSG\RA_UTIL

EzyCom (before version 1.10 of EzyCom): The letter "E" followed by a for-digit, decimal, number that specifies the area number, and this in its turn followed by the path to the message base (without extension).
example:
Path E0001F:\EZY\MSG

  Private <private flag>

This keyword tells whether the message that is to be posted will be private or not. You should enter "Yes" if it should be private or "No" if it is to be seen by everyone. Please notice that when you write echomail, it will automatically be seen by everyone, and if you write netmail, it will automatically be private, so in both these cases, this keyword is not needed.

example:
Private Yes

  Semaphore <path and file name of semaphore file> [*]

With this keyword you can control the posting of the message with a so called semaphore file. If the specified file does not exist, no message will be created. Semaphore files are generally zero byte files that are created by a program to signal that a certain situation has occurred. An example is that a new user has logged in at the BBS. The semaphore file is not removed by Announcer.

This can also be used to post messages only if the message file exists (otherwise Announcer will give an error message), just use the same file name for the semaphore file as for the message file. (To do this, you might also use MinSize).

If you want Announcer to create a semaphore if the message were posted, see the 'Create' keyword.

example:
Semaphore c:\timed\netmail.sem

  Split <number of parts> [*]
  Split @<maximum part size> [*]

If the message file you want to post is large, and not all message processors on the way to the destination are able to handle such large messages, you can use this keyword to split it into any number of parts you wish.

It is also possible to give the maximum allowed size that the resulting message may have, in that case you should prefix the byte count with an at sign ("@"). The size does not include the kludges. The messages are still divided evenly.

When posting to Squish databases, the routines that are used do not support messages larger than approximately 33,000 characters. If you specify larger parts, even if it's because you're leaving out the Split keyword, the message will be splitted so that each part will not exceed 33,000 characters.

If you want the originating address in the SPLIT kludge to be correct, you have to give an Orig address, even for local messages.

You can't use the two variants of the Split keyword together in the same message template.

example:
Split 2
Split @10000

  Subject <subject line>

Here the subject line of the message to be created is specified. If the message base does not restrict it further, the maximum length of the subject line is 75 characters, if you enter a subject that is too long, it will be truncated to fit the maximum length.

example:
Subject Top ten message writers

  TagLine <the tagline that should be used> [*]

With this keyword you determine whether a tagline will be added to the message or not. If you don't specify this keyword, no tagline will be used. You can also set it up so that the same tagline will be used every time (a static tagline), or if it is to vary each time by reading randomly from the file you have specified with the keyword TagLineFile in the global settings (see this section).

If you want the same tagline to be used every time you can give the tagline text after the keyword (a maximum length of 80 characters is allowed), and if you want it to be chosen at random, you only enter a commercial at sign ("@").

example:
TagLine @

  To <receiver name> [*]
  To @<name of mailing list file> [*]

Here the receiver name of the message to be created is specified. If the message base does not restrict it further, the maximum length of the receiver name is 35 characters, if you enter a name that is too long, it will be truncated to fit the maximum length. If you don't enter any name, the receiver field will be empty.

If you wish to create a mailing list (i.e. post the same message to several people), you should enter a commercial at sign ("@") followed by the name of the file that contains all the recipients in the mailing list instead of the receiver name. This file contains lines with receiver address and receiver name separated by a space. For more information, see the chapter "Using mailing lists".

You can't use the two variants of the To keyword together in the same message template.

example:
To All
To @MYLIST.TXT

  UpdatedSend <updating-flag>

With this keyword you can select whether the message file should only be posted if it has been updated since the last posting. If you select "Yes", the file date will be checked against the last posting date, and if it is older, the message will not be posted. If you select "No", no such checking will be made.

example:
UpdatedSend Yes

        {The % variables}
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

To make it easier to post messages to different people without having to edit the configuration file each time, it is possible to enter up to ten parameters on the command line. These parameters can be used them for sender/receiver names, subject lines, file names, receiver address in netmail, and all the other settings that are included in the message templates.

To use the parameters you pass on the command line, you should use the "%1" to "%10" variables in the configuration file. The numbering corresponds to the ordering of the parameters on the command line. They will then be exchanged with the parameters you entered. If you want spaces in the strings, they must be exchanged with an underscore ("_") on the command line.

Example: We want to send a welcoming message to new BBS members, and want a special configuration file that we can use at those times. Then a combination of the /I parameter (for more information on this parameter, please look at the chapter "Command line format"), name on the command line and variables are a good thing to have. Let's say that we define the message templates as follows:

    MSG
    File NEWUSER.TXT
    Subject New user - welcome
    To %1
    From Sysopus Anonymous
    Path SC:\MAX\MSG\SYSOP
    Tagline My little BBS - for you and me
    Private Yes
    .end

If we name the configuration file NEWUSER.INI, and want to welcome a person called John Doe, we enter this at the command line:

    ANNOUNCE /INEWUSER.INI John_Doe

%1 on the To line will then be exchanged for "John Doe", and the message will look like this:

    From: Sysopus Anonymous             (private)
    To:   John Doe
    Subj: New user - welcome
    =============================================
    ..contents of the file newuser.txt..

    ... My little BBS - for you and me

If you forget to enter a name on the command line, the variables will be exchanged for "Announcer", and the message above would have been posted to Announcer.

If you wish to add date and time somewhere, f.ex on the subject line, you can use the special variables "%d%" (date) and "%t%" (time). The date and time will be entered according to your computer's country settings. Unlike %1-%10, these variables can occur inside a string, and then only that part of the string will be changed.

        {Using mailing lists}
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Mailing lists are a convenient way to post the same message to several people at once. Say for example that you're the head of a local computer club, and you want to netmail its member with a bulletin each month. Posting individual messages, or setting up Announcer with one template for each receiver is tedious, the easy way out is to set up a mailing list.

To tell Announcer that it is a mailing list you want to do, and not a normal mail, you need to create a file containing all the names and addresses, and point to that file in the message template. The format of the mailing list file is straightforward, each line contains the address of the recipient, followed by the name, the two fields separated with a single space. For Announcer to understand that it is a list of names it should look for, prefix the file name at the To keyword with a commercial at sign ("@").

Announcer will identify messages posted to a mailing list by inserting a special kludge "NOTE", which shows the name of the mailing list file. If you want to change this to something more descriptive, enter the name you want on the first line of the mailing list file, prefixed with a semi colon (";").

Example, a computer club newsletter:

First, we create a file "NEWSLTR.LST", which contains the list of the recipients (only two people in this example):

    ;Computer Newsletter
    7:342/169.31 John Doe
    8:412/961.17 Jane Doe

Then we set up a message template that points to the mailing list file:

    Msg
    File NEWSLTR.TXT
    Subject Computer Club X Newsletter
    To @NEWSLTR.LST
    From Bill Doe
    Orig 7:342/117
    Path JC:\RA2\NETMAIL
    Distribution Netmail
    .end

This setup will result in these two message (only header and NOTE kludge is shown in this example):

    From: Bill Doe (7:342/117)
    To:   John Doe (7:342/169.31)
    Subj: Computer Club X Newsletter
    =============================================
    ^aNOTE: Mailing list "Computer Newsletter"
    ...

    From: Bill Doe (7:342/117)
    To:   Jane Doe (8:412/961.17)
    Subj: Computer Club X Newsletter
    =============================================
    ^aNOTE: Mailing list "Computer Newsletter"
    ...

Since only one MSGID is recorded for each template, no REPLY kludges will be created for mailing lists, even if you have set "ReplyKludge Yes" in global configuration.

Please note that it is not possible to combine the two forms of the To keyword. Furthermore, if the message file is not found, the @ sign will be considered a part of the receiver name, which makes it possible to post to someone that has a @ as the first character of the name.

        {Creating .PKT files}
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

Announcer has the capability of directly creating type "2+" PKT file (mail bundles). This is called ".PKT mode". The operation of Announcer differs slightly from how it normally works, and this is why it is covered in its own chapter.

To initiate .PKT mode, you need to define the four global keywords "PktMode", "PktPath", "PktFrom" and "PktTo". If you omit any of them, Announcer will have trouble operating, but due to the way Announcer processes the configuration file, it will not abort with an error message. The two keywords "PktPwd" and "BinkleyName" are optional. Here follows detailed descriptions of these six keywords (alphabetically):

  BinkleyName <Yes/No> [optional]

With this option set to "Yes", you instruct Announcer to use the BinkleyTerm name style, "aaaabbbb.OUT", where aaaa is the destination net number in hexadecimal and bbbb is the destination node number, also in hexadecimal. With this, you do not need to go through any other message processing software to send a message in conjunction with a Binkley-style mailer.

BinkleyName defaults to "No", which yields a packet name of "nnnnnnnn.PKT", where nnnnnnnn is the number of seconds since January 1st 1970 (Unix time) written in hexadecimal. This is the same type of number that is used for the MSGIDs.

If the PKT file that Announcer tries to write to should already exist, Announcer will append the messages in the end. The contents of the PKT file's header will not be changed.

example:
BinkleyName Yes

  PktFrom <originating address>

This keyword specifies the originating address of the .PKT file. This is generally the same address as the originating address of the messages contained in the packets.

example:
PktFrom 2:204/145.42

  PktMode <temporary path for .MSG files>

PktMode is the "magic" keyword that puts Announcer in .PKT mode. It also defines the path to put Announcer's temporary .MSG files (Announcer will not directly create the .PKT file, but will instead create one .MSG file for each message, in the directory defined here. These messages will then be packed into the .PKT file).

All files with the extension .MSG will be removed from this path when Announeer is done. Announcer will add ALL .MSG files that are found in this directory, not only the ones it has created itself.

example:
PktMode C:\TEMP

  PktPath <directory to put the .PKT file in>

This keyword specifies the directory in which the .PKT file will be created.

example:
PktPath C:\BINKLEY\INBOUND

  PktPwd <password in .PKT file> [optional]

With this optional keyword, you can specify a password to be inserted into the .PKT file.

example:
PktPwd SECRET

  PktTo <destination address>

This keyword specifies the .PKT file's destination address. It may be the same as the originating address.

example:
PktTo 2:204/145.0

Please note, that the keyword "EchoTossLog" has no effect when Announcer is in .PKT mode.

In addition to these changes in the global section, some minor changes apply to the message templates:

  Distribution <type of message area>

This keyword is mandatory in .PKT mode. Also, the "Local" distribution method is not valid in this mode. Only "NetMail" and "EchoMail" can be used.

example:
Distribution EchoMail

  Echo <echo tag>

This keyword is mandatory for writing echomail in .PKT mode, since the echo tag must be known. It is not used for an EchoToss.Log/EchoMail.Jam file, neither together with a tosser configuration file.

example:
Echo ISDN.EUR

The "Path" keyword cannot be used in .PKT mode. It will abort with an error message. Since all .MSG files are created in the temporary directory, there is no need to specify an alternative path.

It should also be noted that .PKT mode and normal mode can be combined in one configuration file, but only in a limited fashion. Once .PKT mode is initiated, you can't turn it off. It is also only possible to create one .PKT file per configuration file. If you enter a new PktMode keyword, the previous one will be discarded, and the .PKT file will be created from the newly defined directory. The same applies to the PktPath keyword.

To combine normal and .PKT mode, the configuration can look like this:

    LogFile C:\ANNOUNCE\ANNOUNCE.LOG

    ; This message is posted in normal mode, in a
    ; local Squish area
    Msg
    From SysOp
    To All
    Subject Top Ten
    File TOPTEN.TXT
    Path SC:\MAX\MSG\TOPTENS
    .End

    ; Now, we initiate .PKT mode
    PktMode C:\TEMP
    PktPath C:\SQUISH\INBOUND
    PktFrom 2:204/145.42
    PktTo 2:204/145.42

    ; This message will be posted in netmail via a .PKT file
    Msg
    From Announcer
    To SysOp
    Subject Top Ten
    File TOPTEN.TXT
    Orig 2:204/145.42
    Dest 2:204/145.42
    Distribution NetMail
    .End

        {Language}
        ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

This program can run in both Swedish and English. The program will check your country setting (COUNTRY in CONFIG.SYS) and will automatically set to Swedish if you live in Sweden, Norway, Denmark or Finland, and otherwise to English. To override this setting you should use the environment variable ANNLANG. It can have either of these two values:

    SWE    Swedish
    ENG    English

You set it up with the command SET, for example:

    SET ANNLANG=ENG

will set the language to English. If you want to set the language automatically when you start your computer, you can enter that line into your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
